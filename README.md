# RFC: Proposed Office Amenities for Enhanced Productivity and Happiness

This document provides suggestions for potential additions to our office environment that could enhance the overall productivity and happiness of the team. Each proposed item is discussed in detail, considering its potential benefits, possible drawbacks, and financial implications.

## Recommendations

### Carpeting

Carpeting can considerably influence an office environment, directly impacting acoustics, comfort, and the overall aesthetic of the workspace.

In terms of comfort, a well-chosen carpet can absorb sound and dampen echoes, reducing baseline noise levels and creating a quieter, more peaceful atmosphere conducive to concentration and deep thinking. Carpeting also provides a softer and warmer surface underfoot compared to hard flooring, which can alleviate fatigue for those who spend extended periods standing or moving around the office. Most importantly, it decreases the drift of chairs and balance boards, further improving their ergonomics, usability, and comfort.

However, there are drawbacks to consider. Carpets require regular cleaning to maintain their appearance and hygiene, particularly in high-traffic areas, which could add to ongoing maintenance costs. While our space has regular janitorial services, daily vacuuming may be out of scope. Considering this, it's proposed that we consider implementing a robot vacuum cleaner that can consistently maintain the carpet overnight with minimal human effort.

Moreover, it's proposed that we consider carpet tiles due to their ease of installation and flexibility, with simple replacement in case of stains or damage to specific sections.

The financial investment is relatively minor and the long-term benefits in terms of productivity, comfort, and aesthetics may justify this investment.

### Window Seat

Quality rest and diverse environments are essential for maintaining high levels of productivity and creativity. A plush and comfortable window seat could be a great addition to our office, offering team members the opportunity to enjoy power naps during breaks while maintaining the clean and attractive aesthetic of the space.

### Quality Tea

A good cup of tea can be refreshing and invigorating, particularly during extended work hours. However, the tea brand currently used in the office seems to have packaging issues, often leading to the tea exploding in closed-cap mugs. It's suggested that we explore alternative high-quality tea brands to enhance our break times.

We could possibly bring this issue to Industrious' attention, as they're responsible for the office's food and beverage supply and commonly accept tenant suggestions. It's important to note that they previously had a high-quality tea selection, but it was removed during COVID for hygienic reasons due to it being sourced loose-leaf and has not returned since.

Several potential reasons could explain why it has not returned. It could be an oversight in the post-pandemic period, or it may have been changed to reduce costs. If the latter is the case, we should consider that they may not wish to significantly increase costs, and we could explore existing brands to find a better-quality product at similar cost.

If persuading Industrious to modify their tea selection is not feasible, we could consider purchasing our own tea supply. Although this would entail a small, recurring, partially tax-deductible expense, it would let us maintain a high-quality tea selection independent of Industrious's supply chain. We would need to find appropriate storage for the tea and keep it organized and clean. If opting for loose-leaf tea, potential spillage in our interior office should be minimized, since these spaces are cleaned less frequently and thoroughly than common areas.

### Plants

Having a touch of nature within our office space can drastically improve its visual appeal while also promoting a sense of well-being among team members. Numerous studies have shown that the addition of indoor plants can lead to several benefits, including reduced stress, improved air quality, and enhanced productivity.

Plants can serve as a natural air purifier by absorbing toxins, releasing oxygen, and increasing humidity, thereby creating a healthier workspace. Certain species, such as the Snake Plant, English Ivy, or Peace Lily, are particularly effective at improving indoor air quality. This can result in fewer health issues, such as headaches, eye irritation, and respiratory problems, which can, in turn, lead to reduced absenteeism.

Not only do plants enhance the physical environment, but they also contribute to improved mental well-being. Being surrounded by greenery can reduce stress and foster a more relaxed and positive atmosphere, hence enhancing the teamâ€™s overall mood and productivity.

However, adding plants to our workspace also requires thoughtful consideration. Plants need regular care and maintenance, which can involve watering, fertilizing, and occasionally repotting or pruning them. Moreover, we need to be mindful of choosing plant types that are suitable for the specific light and temperature conditions in our office.
To minimize the maintenance responsibilities, it's suggested we opt for low-maintenance plants. This can ensure the plants stay healthy and continue to benefit our workspace without adding a significant burden to the team.

In terms of financial implications, the basic cost of purchasing plants and planters can be quite reasonable. But it is important that caring for them does not become a burden on productivity.

In conclusion, the addition of plants to our office environment has the potential to yield significant returns in improved air quality, reduced stress, and enhanced productivity.

### Cabinetry

Optimizing storage through considered cabinetry is a practical and aesthetic way to improve our office environment. Whether it's for storing documents, tech equipment, or personal items, well-designed cabinets can help keep our workspace organized, clutter-free, and visually pleasing.

In terms of productivity, a well-organized office can save time and minimize distractions. Having a dedicated cabinet for storing files and equipment can make it easier to locate necessary items without wasting time searching for them. A clutter-free environment can also reduce distractions and contribute to a more focused and efficient workspace.

From an aesthetic point of view, cabinets can contribute significantly to the overall look and feel of the office. By choosing cabinetry that matches our office decor, we can maintain a cohesive and professional look. Furthermore, integrating cabinets with doors can hide clutter and present a cleaner, more streamlined appearance.

However, it's important to note that installing new cabinetry carries both financial and spatial considerations. Custom-built cabinets can be expensive, but they offer the advantage of being tailored to fit our specific needs and space. Alternatively, ready-made cabinets are a more cost-effective solution but may not provide the same level of customization.
Moreover, it's necessary to consider the space constraints of our office. While additional storage is beneficial, we need to ensure that adding cabinets won't overcrowd the office or impede movement around the workspace.

In terms of installation, we can engage professionals to ensure secure and neat fitting, though this adds to the overall cost. However, the potential benefits in terms of organization, space optimization, aesthetics, and productivity make this a worthwhile investment. We may also want to explore options for environmentally friendly materials when choosing our cabinetry to adhere to our corporate responsibility goals.

In summary, thoughtfully planned cabinetry has the potential to significantly enhance our workspace both practically and aesthetically, improving productivity and happiness within the team. This can be considered as the highest-cost, highest-reward proposal so far.
