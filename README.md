# Proposed Office Amenities for Enhanced Productivity and Happiness

This document provides suggestions for potential additions to our office environment that could enhance the overall productivity and happiness of the team. Each proposed item is discussed in detail, considering its benefits, possible drawbacks, and financial implications.

## Treadmill

Physical health and fitness contribute significantly to mental acuity and productivity. It is, therefore, proposed that we consider incorporating a treadmill into the office environment. Regular use of a treadmill can boost cardiovascular health, increase energy levels, and improve mood—factors that directly impact work performance.

However, the cost implication is a crucial factor to consider. Treadmills are considerably more expensive than many other office amenities. Additionally, while treadmills could offer general health benefits, they may not directly contribute to core strength and body aesthetics, factors that some team members might prioritize. 

An alternative could be our balance board, which directly targets core strength. However, balance boards may not provide the same level of cardiovascular exercise that treadmills do. We should weigh the cost against the potential benefits of both options to make a well-informed decision.

## Ergonomic Pillow

Quality rest is essential for maintaining high levels of productivity and creativity. An ergonomic pillow could be a great addition to our office, allowing team members to enjoy power naps during breaks. Besides, such pillows can help maintain proper posture during extended work periods, thus preventing back and neck pain.

## Quality Tea

A good cup of tea can be refreshing and invigorating, especially during long work hours. However, the current tea brand used in the office appears to have packaging issues, often resulting in the tea exploding in closed-cap mugs. It is proposed that we explore other high-quality tea brands to improve this aspect of our break times.

## Smoothie Blender

The idea of a smoothie blender in the office sounds exciting—it could promote healthier snack habits among the team. However, practical implications need to be considered. Blenders can be noisy and disruptive in a work environment. They also require regular cleaning, which could become a hassle if not properly managed. It is suggested to consider these factors before deciding on this option.
